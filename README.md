### Book Review

+ Review by  Nikolay Kyurkchiev (Plovdiv)
  ```
  This book is based on the lecture notes that the authors have used at Chennai Mathematical
  Institute (CMI) and Indian Statistical Institute (ISI). The quantitative methods are explained
  in detail with examples from real financial problems like option pricing, risk management,
  portfolio selection, etc.
  ...
  The monograph is exclusively professionally written and the materials are presented in an
  attractive way. This book may be useful to senior undergraduate and postgraduate students.

This book equips students to meet the quantitative and computational demands of the finance sector. It meticulously explains quantitative methods, using real financial scenarios such as option pricing, risk management, and portfolio selection as examples. The book includes `R` programming language codes for implementing these methods, accompanied by tables and figures featuring real data to illustrate their applications. References to related literature are included to facilitate further exploration of specific areas of interest. With its comprehensive coverage of economic, statistical, mathematical, and computational theory, the book enhances understanding. It offers a wide-ranging scope, with clear explanations of connections between different sections. While the primary audience is graduate students, advanced undergraduates will also find it accessible. Moreover, practitioners in the finance industry can derive valuable insights from its content.

**Note**: Chapter 5 does not have any code.
